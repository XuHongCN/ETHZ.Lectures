Copy our StackOverflow export to your storage account.\n2. Import the database dump into a new SQL database.\n3. Test querying the server.\n\n### Step 1: Create your own SQL server.\n\n(This is an adaptation of [this tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-get-started/).)\n\n1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the left menu, click on \"Create a resource\", search for \"SQL server\", then select \"SQL server (logical server)\" and finally \"create\".\n2. Fill in the form below with values of your choice. Your form also asks for a resource group. Create a new resource group, which you may call \"exercise01\". Select \"Pin to dashboard\".\n\n![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/media/sql-database-get-started-portal/new-sql-database-basics.png)\n\n3. To check whether the database server has been created, go to \"Resource groups\" in the menu on the left, then open your new resource group (\"exercise01\") from the list. You should see the SQL server in the list.\n\n4. Now to the settings of your database server, then open the firewall settings. Open the firewall for everyone by adding a rule named \"open for all\" with start IP \"0.0.0.0\" and end IP \"255.255.255.255\" in the following form. Click \"save\" to finish.\n\n&nbsp;\n![](https://exerciseassets.blob.core.windows.net/exercise01/firewall.png)\n\n### Step 2: Copy our StackOverflow export to your storage account\n\n1. First you need to create a storage account. (More about that next week!) To do that, go to \"Storage accounts\" in the left menu. Click on \"Add\" at the top of the blade and fill out the following form. Choose the \"exercise01\" resource group, select \"Locally redundant storage (LRS)\" as replication mode, and let all other values at their defaults.\n\n2. Open the new storage account (you may need to wait a while before it has been created), go to \"Access keys\" (under \"Settings\") and copy one of its keys to the clipboard.\n\n&nbsp;\n![Image of Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/includes/media/storage-view-keys-include/portal-connection-string.png)\n\n3.
